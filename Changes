Revision history for Perl extension TapeChanger::MTX.

v0.5    Fri Nov  9 15:39:15 CST 2001
Initial version, based off old mtx-changer code (also self-written).
Documentation and such are written.


v0.51b 	  Tue Nov 13 09:16:49 CST 2001
Took out support for multiple drives in the 'eject' option, because it
operates weirdly.  'reportstatus' is a bit different.

v0.60b		Tue Nov 13 16:00:29 CST 2001
Fixed 'nexttape' and such to eject the drive first.  

v0.61b		Wed May 22 10:13:13 CDT 2002
Added a 'nexttape' script.  It's handy a lot.
