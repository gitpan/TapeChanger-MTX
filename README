TapeChanger::MTX - use 'mtx' to manipulate a tape library
=========================================================

TapeChanger::MTX is a module to manipulate a tape library using the 'mtx'
tape library program.  It is meant to work with a simple shell/perl script
to load and unload tapes as appropriate, and to provide a interface for
more complicated programs to do the same.  It comes with a few basic
scripts to exercise much of the functionality of the module.

Prerequisites
=============

You must have Perl 5.6.0 or greater installed, as well as an installed
'mtx' binary and a tape changer/drive on your system.  

Installation Notes
==================

Installing this software is easy:

  perl Makefile.pl
  make
  make test
  make install

Documentation
=============

All of the documentation is in the manual pages - 'man TapeChanger::MTX'
after installation, or 'pod2text MTX.pm | less' right now.  'perldoc
TapeChanger::MTX' probably also works.
